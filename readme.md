# Differentiable Evolution Tree Search

A JAX-based implementation of differentiable algorithms for phylogenetic tree search, providing a modern alternative to traditional heuristic methods through gradient-based optimization.

## Overview

This project explores differentiable phylogenetic algorithms that leverage the JAX ecosystem for high-performance, JIT-compiled tree search operations. By implementing classic phylogenetic algorithms (such as Sankoff's algorithm for maximum parsimony) in a differentiable framework, we enable gradient-based optimization of both tree topologies and ancestral sequences.

The core innovation lies in making traditionally discrete phylogenetic operations differentiable while maintaining computational efficiency through JAX's functional programming paradigm and automatic differentiation capabilities.

## Key Features & Differentiable Components

### Differentiable Algorithms

- **Sankoff's Algorithm**: Differentiable implementation for maximum parsimony scoring
- **Tree Topology Optimization**: Gradient-based search over tree space
- **Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction**: Differentiable inference of internal node sequences
- **Batch Processing**: Vectorized operations for multiple tree evaluations

### JAX Integration

- **JIT Compilation**: All core algorithms are JIT-compatible for optimal performance
- **Functional Programming**: Immutable data structures and pure functions throughout
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Full gradient computation for all model parameters
- **VMAP Support**: Efficient batching across multiple trees or datasets
